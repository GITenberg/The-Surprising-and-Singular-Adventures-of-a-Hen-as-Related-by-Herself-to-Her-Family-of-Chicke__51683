  <h2 class='c004'>ADVENTURES OF A HEN.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c005'>In the beautiful vale of Ravensworth,
is situated a commodious farm house:
the proprietors treat all their domestic
animals with humanity, and provide
every possible convenience for them.
The poultry yard is large and clean, at
the bottom of it runs a clear brook, in
which you may always see a number
of ducks and geese sporting.</p>

<p class='c006'>One day, as an old speckled hen
was scratching up some grubs for her
numerous family, one of her chicks
came running up to her. Oh, mother,
pray do go and kill the young bantam
cock! Why? replied the mother. Oh!
he has behaved to me worse than ever
any chicken behaved to another, and I
will be revenged; I know I cannot
fight him myself, but I hope you will.
Not till I know how he has offended.
Why, I had just scratched up a fine
fat worm, and was cackling with delight,
thinking what a nice feast I
should have, when the nasty little
bantum came, snatched it from me,
ran away with it, and eat it, even before
my face.</p>

<p class='c006'>Doubtless he has behaved very improperly,
replied the old hen; but
that is no reason you should; the best
way of revenging yourself, is to take
no notice of him, or ever play with him
again; instead of wasting your time in
quarrelling, search for another. What!
and not punish him for so very unjust
an action! did you ever hear of any
thing so shameful before? Oh yes,
many things. I should like to hear
one of them. Well, my dear, I have
no objection; but as it is so very hot,
it would be better to go under the
shade of the laburnum, and I will then
relate to you the chief occurrences of
my eventful life. The old hen then
walked stately on, followed by her
chickens; and having got upon a stone,
to be a little higher than her audience,
the young ones ranged themselves
round her, and she began as follows:</p>

<p class='c006'>I was hatched with six more in a
large nest, formed by my mother; as
soon as we broke the shell, she carefully
threw out every thing she thought
would hurt our tender bodies, spread
her warm wings over us, and prattled
us to sleep: when we awoke, we complained
of hunger; she immediately
went forth in search of food, but, alas!
we never saw her more.</p>

<p class='c006'>There chanced to be a large strange
dog in the yard, my mother thinking
he came to destroy us, flew at him,
the contest was unequal, the dog provoked,
seized my mother by the neck,
and strangled her.</p>

<p class='c006'>We lay cold and comfortless, wondering
what had become of our parent.
Before night, two of my brothers died;
and we should all soon have shared
their fate, had not a little girl, the farmer's
daughter, found us: she took us
to the fire, and fed us with a little
warm milk and bread, which revived
us; she then wrapped us up in flannel,
and put us in a little basket, which she
put in the chimney corner. She fed us
very regularly; but I suppose not
with proper food, as all my poor
sisters and brothers died, probably
I was stronger than they. My little
mistress grew very fond of me, as I
would eat out of her hand, and
when she called chickee, would run
to her.</p>

<p class='c006'>As I grew large, I was very troublesome
in flying upon the tables, and
pecking at every thing; many severe
blows I got from the farmer and his
servants; who always ended by saying,
if that troublesome fowl is not sent into
the poultry yard, it shall certainly be
killed; but my mistress always begged
that I might stay a little longer, for she
feared the other fowls would drive
me away.</p>

<p class='c006'>And indeed I had not endeavoured
to make friends of any of them; but
when the door was open, and I could
see them, I insulted them, with calling
out, poor creatures! you are obliged to
work hard all day, and can scarcely get
enough to eat, while I am fed plentifully
with the greatest dainties, and
have nothing to do but amuse myself.
An old hen who had been a friend of
my mother's, offered to supply her
place, in teaching me how to scratch
for myself; but I rejected her kind
advice with disdain.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/p010.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p><i>Nursing the chicken.</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>At last my young mistress could
keep me no longer, her father insisted
that I should either be killed, or go
with the rest of my species, and setting
open the door they fairly hunted me
out.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now it was my turn to experience
mortification: numbers had been witnesses
of my disgraceful exit, and
taunted me with, so her ladyship is
obliged to come among the working
people; I suppose food will come flying
to her, as she is of too much consequence
to work; I wonder if her
claws are differently made to ours?</p>

<p class='c006'>In the evening, when the servant
came to scatter corn, I was very hungry,
and thought that would be a nice
treat for me; but, alas! coarse as the
food was, it was denied me; no one
would suffer me to partake, but flew at,
and pecked me whenever I attempted
it, saying, no, no, mistress, you shall
have none of this, we who have done
our duty, may be rewarded; but what
have you done? nothing. Thus was
I driven from society, a thousand times
did I wish that I had never known any
other pleasure than the rest, and that
my mistress had not nursed me so
tenderly; but she did it from kindness,
and I shall ever respect her
memory.</p>

<p class='c006'>One morning I was rudely seized,
and put with several more into a small
wicker basket, to be taken to market:
my sensations upon that occasion, no
words can describe; to the market we
came, and were exposed for sale.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/p014.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p><i>Putting the hen into the basket.</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Numbers came to inquire our price, I
was lifted up, and pricked, and pulled
about, to see whether I was fat; but
the distress I had of late been in, had
made me very thin, I was therefore
always thrown down again, with this
observation, why, what a bag of bones
this hussey is, I would not have her if
you would give her to me.</p>

<p class='c006'>All my companions were sold, and
I remained till night tired and hungry.
Towards the close of the market, when
the people were preparing to return
home, a little girl passed by me with a
piece of bread in her hand; urged by
hunger I pecked at it, and when she
patted me, though my poor sides were
all over bruises, I would not appear
as if she hurt me, but rubbed my head
against her hand; she seemed much
delighted with me, crying out, Oh!
what a nice tame little creature, how
I wish you were mine, but I fear I
have not money enough to buy you.
Why what can you give? (said the man
who brought me from the farm.) I have
but one shilling; but I will give you
all that. Very well, you shall have it
then, for I am sure there is not any
use in taking it back.</p>

<p class='c006'>Little Ann, my new mistress, took
me directly home; her mother lived in
a thatched cottage, and was very poor:
when she heard Ann had given all her
money for me, she was very angry. Oh
dear mother! you know it will soon
lay eggs, which we can sell, and get
chickens besides. You foolish girl,
you cannot get both, what do you intend
to feed it with? and we have no
place to keep it in. Oh, we can keep it
very well in the wood house, I will
put up a perch for it, we will give it
some crumbs to night, and to morrow
it will provide for itself.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/p018.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p><i>Purchasing the hen.</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>I accordingly had a good supper
and went to rest in a clay hovel, very
different to what I had been accustomed
to, but I thought how much
worse my situation might have been;
my fatigue and anxiety soon put me
into a sound sleep, from which I was
awakened, by being violently laid hold
of. When I opened my eyes, I saw a
great ugly man who held a sack and
lanthorn in his hand. Oh! oh! mistress
hen, I did not expect such luck,
you will be a nice addition to my
stock: he then threw me into the sack,
which he flung over his shoulder, and
walked a considerable way; this mode
of carrying me, together with my sore
bruises, produced such violent pain,
that I grew quite insensible; when I
recovered, I found myself confined with
several of my fellow creatures in a
large hen-coop, they told me they had
all been stolen by the same man, some
had been torn from their children, husbands,
or parents. I asked for what
purpose. What! can you be ignorant
that he intends taking us to market to
be killed, and eaten? At the thought
of being exposed in my present miserable
condition to be handled by the
multitude, my blood froze in my
veins.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/p022.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p><i>Stealing the hen.</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>I passed about a week in this coop;
we were well fed, as our keeper wished
to make us fat. One night we were
alarmed with a tremendous noise, I
turned to inquire the cause, when I saw
the brave white cock trembling like a
chick: oh! said he, give yourselves
over now, nothing can save us from
destruction, we shall all be devoured;
no sooner had he said this, but a large
fox entered; Oh! my children, how
can I describe the horrors of the bloody
scene which followed, even at this distance
of time, the recollection draws
tears from my eyes; I alone remained
of all my companions; he was advancing
to me, when some noise in the
yard frightened him, and he ran away,
leaving me more dead than alive with
fright.</p>

<p class='c006'>After he had been gone some
time, I considered that if I stayed
where I was, in a few days I should
be taken to market: the board which
the fox had broken down, offered the
way to escape; but where was I to go
to, how should I know the way to the
cottage of Ann? but the market was
worse to my imagination than any
other thing. I went through the opening,
flew down, and found myself in
the open road, I ran as fast as possible,
only stopping to take breath, or a
mouthful of food; many frights had I
before night, from dogs, boys, &amp;c. As
the sun was setting, I came to a fine
large garden, with a high wall round
it; I flew to the top, and not seeing
any person in it, I thought I would
look out for some grubs, or worms, in
a fine bed of newly turned up mould,
and then go to rest upon one of the
trees; I had scarcely began my search,
when I found in the ground some very
pleasant tasted seeds, which I began
to devour, when I received a blow
upon my wing from a stone, and looking
up, I beheld the gardener coming
forward in a furious passion. So I have
now discovered who it is that scratches
up all my seeds; but these are the last
you shall ever taste, believe me; saying
this, he seized me in the most brutal
manner. I screamed violently; by this
time, another man came up, and said,
Why, Thomas, what will you do with
it? if it had been a cock, you might
have had fine sport with it, in throwing
sticks at it. And why can't I at a hen,
pray? Oh, why nobody ever does.
Well then, I will be the first to
throw; I will take her to the village,
tie her to a stake, and the boys shall
have a throw for a halfpenny a
piece.</p>

<p class='c006'>While they were carrying me away,
a lovely looking boy asked them what
they were going to do with me. To
make a cock-shye. Master, what is
that? To throw sticks at it till it is
killed. Oh, heavens! you surely are
jesting, you cannot have so much barbarity?
As to that, it has had the
barbarity to eat up my seeds, to repay
me for them, the nasty creature shall
pay its life.</p>

<p class='c006'>The young gentleman, whose name
was Augustus Manly, entreated that
he might purchase me, and offered
half a crown; but the man determined
I should have a few blows, and tied
me to the stake, when Augustus seeming
to be inspired with more than
ordinary courage, threw down his half
crown, and lifting me from the ground,
when the barbarous gardeners were
not looking, ran off with me in his
arms: the men could not overtake
him by running, but were cowardly
enough to throw a stone, which struck
me on the breast; but by the care of
this humane boy, I soon entirely recovered.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/p028.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p><i>Taking away the hen.</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>My master was a pupil in a very
large school; the house in which he
boarded, accommodated twelve more,
but none so kind as himself; many
slight injuries I received, but I considered
how much worse my lot had
been, and felicitated myself accordingly;
but too soon I felt the most
acute torments.</p>

<p class='c006'>My master was often laughed at by
the other boys for his fondness for me:
I loved him so much, that whenever
he came into the yard, I ran to meet
him, would feed out of his hand, or fly
upon his shoulder, but this I would
never do to any other boy, and by this
I suppose it was which made them
hate me.</p>

<p class='c006'>One day two of them came into the
garden to read, the story they fixed
upon was, unfortunately for me, that
cruel one of Diogenes stripping a cock
of all its feathers, and throwing it into
the middle of the school where Plato
was instructing his disciples; crying,
'there is Plato's man for you.' They
laughed heartily at this, and one of
them cried out, Oh! the most admirable
thought has struck me! let us
serve Manly's hen in the same way,
and when he is in bed to night, we
will open the door, and throw it at him,
and cry out, 'there is Manly's lady for
you.' This was highly approved of,
and I was accordingly seized, and
stripped of my feathers. Oh! Dickey,
was not this far more unjust than the
young bantum's taking your worm
from you? that could give you no
pain, but the tortures I endured, no
one can possibly imagine; the blood
flowed copiously, the skin was torn
from the flesh, I wished for death to
put an end to my torments, but that
was denied.</p>

<p class='c006'>At night they fulfilled their intention,
my benefactor was truly distressed to
see my miserable condition, and taking
me to the mistress of the house, and
implored her assistance to cure me;
she wished to have me killed instantly,
but that he would not consent to. As
she was a humane woman, she endeavoured
to cure me; and got some oil,
which she carefully rubbed over me,
and I was kept in a place where these
wicked boys could not come to me. I
had the pleasure of hearing that these
boys had been expelled from the school,
the greatest disgrace that could befall
them.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was long before I was entirely recovered;
the next holidays Augustus
determined to take me home with him,
and leave me in charge of his amiable
sister, whom he knew would nurse me
tenderly. There I may say I was perfectly
happy for some time. I became
a mother, and had the delight of seeing
my children beloved by Augustus and
his sister.</p>

<p class='c006'>Once, owing to the carelessness of
a servant, I hatched some duck eggs,
I did not perceive the mistake, till
taking my chickens (as I thought
them) out, to teach them to scratch,
they all ran towards the water; in vain
I called after them to stop, that they
would be drowned if they attempted
to go in; deaf to my entreaties, they
threw themselves in, I came to the
pond in all the agonies of despair, expecting
to see all my precious little ones
dead; but, to my astonishment, they
were all swimming merrily. A duck
with whom I was intimate (for I made
it a rule to treat all the domestic fowls
with civility) came up and assured me
she would take care of my young
charge while they were on the water,
and teach them to swim.</p>

<p class='c006'>Soon after, Augustus intended giving
a supper to some of his friends, and it
was proposed that each one should
bring his favourite dish; Charles Mellish,
Manly's cousin, was staying with
him, he was a boy of an ardent temper,
and would do any thing by way of
frolic, or what he called fun; from the
time this supper was proposed, he determined
his dish should differ from
every other persons, he accordingly
procured from the cook a large pie dish
and cover, and when the party assembled,
he came into the poultry yard,
seized me, and in spite of my peeking
and scratching, forced me into it,
covered me over with leaves, and
placed the lid on; when he entered
the parlour, I heard a number of little
voices say, I wonder what Charles has
got. He replied, something different
to any one else I think; but before I
let you see what it is, I must make an
agreement that if it is different, every
one of the ladies shall give me a kiss;
but if any other person ever thought
of bringing the same, every one in the
room shall have the liberty to give me
a slap on the face. This being agreed
to, he set the dish upon the table, and
took off the lid; I, who had been
sadly cramped, immediately flew out,
to the great astonishment of all present.
I suppose master Charles received the
reward from the ladies, but of that
I did not wait to be witness; but ran
out of the room as fast as possible.</p>

<p class='c006'>Not long after, I was again seized
by the same gentleman, who having
discovered that miss Manly, and a
party of her friends were assembled
round a small fire, telling terrible
stories of ghosts and murders, resolved
to frighten them; he placed a ladder
by the side of the chimney, and
mounting it, put me in at the top. I
was glad to escape from him, so I flew
down the chimney, carrying the soot
with me, which suddenly put out the
fire; and when I entered the room, the
most terrible screams were heard from
all quarters; the servants soon came
in with lights, to know what misfortune
had happened, to occasion such
an uproar. I had hidden myself in a
corner of the room; one of the young
ladies said it must be a ghost, that they
had been sitting very quietly, when
suddenly they heard a tremendous
noise, the fire was extinguished in an
instant, that a thick cloud of smoke
followed, and a great black thing, the
shape of which she could not distinguish,
knocked against her face, and
threw her down. By this time, Charles
had joined them, and hearing such
exaggerated stories, burst into a hearty
laugh. You may laugh, said one of
the ladies, but had you been here when
it happened, you would have been as
frightened as we were, it could not be
fancy, for see the fire is out, and what
a strong smell of sulphur is in the
room.</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p><i>The fright.</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>What would you think of me, if I
discovered the cause of this wonderful
affair? I should think you very clever
indeed. Well then, give me a candle
and I will soon find the ghost; he then
took one off the table and by its
assistance, soon discovered poor me
sitting disconsolate under the table; at
this the whole party joined in a hearty
laugh; except myself, who had got
some soot in my eyes, which made
them very painful. Augustus took
me in his arms, my poor hen, said he,
you have had many strange adventures,
and if you should ever take it into your
head to write them (for all animals
write their lives now-a-days), you shall
make good mention of me, for I will
now give you a good supper after your
troubles.</p>

<p class='c006'>At the idea of a hen's writing her
adventures, the party was highly diverted;
no, said they, that can never
be, as a domestic fowl can know
nothing out of the poultry yard, and
that would never be worth reading;
but I think, my children, that some of
the adventures I have gone through,
are almost as wonderful as those of
cats and dogs, which I hear are published
in little books: talking of cats,
I once had a severe combat with one
of them, in which I nearly lost one of
my eyes, and had many feathers torn
off: as to dogs, I was always afraid
of approaching them, remembering the
melancholy fate of my poor mother.</p>

<p class='c006'>One time, when the family was
paying a visit, orders were sent to the
servant to fatten one of the fowls, then
kill it, and send it to a poor neighbour
who was sick; I was the one pitched
upon, and was confined in a little
coop, where I could scarcely turn
round, much less take that exercise
which is necessary to health, my confinement
was still more distressing,
when looking out, I could see all my
companions enjoying themselves, how
I longed to join in their sports.</p>

<p class='c006'>I loathed the quantities of food
brought me, and would freely have
given a saucer full of delicious white
bread softened with cream, for the delight
of scratching up a worm for myself;
but though I had no appetite I
ate, because I had nothing else to do;
and that being such voluptuous food,
soon made me excessively fat, which
caused me much pain, as I could
scarcely breathe. I look forward with
joy to the time, when the murderer's
knife would end my miseries; the day
was fixed.</p>

<p class='c006'>On the morning of that day, to my
astonishment, I saw Augustus enter
the yard, he had returned from his
visit much sooner than was expected:
when I saw him, I thought of all his
kindness, and wished to hear him
speak once more before I died; for
which purpose, I called as intelligibly
as I could to him; at last I had the
pleasure of hearing him say, what can
be the matter with that poor hen
which is confined, I never heard so
pitiful a cry! Upon seeing it was his
old favourite, Oh! my poor bird, said
he, were you so near being killed; but
I am very glad I have come in time to
save you; saying this, he opened the
door, and gave me liberty, that greatest
of all blessings.</p>

<p class='c006'>I was expressing, in my language,
my thanks, when Susan entered with
her knife; Oh! Susan, how could you
think of killing this my favourite?
Pray sir, how should I know which
you please to call your favourite? All
hens are alike to me, I caught the one
which was nearest to me, and as it is
now fattened, we must have it, and
you may take another favourite. No,
this one you shall never kill; it is
cruel to destroy any, but this which
knows me so well, and is so tame, I
never will have it killed; so saying,
he carried me away, leaving Sue in a
great passion.</p>

<p class='c006'>Soon after, my young master had to
go to a boarding school, near London;
his mamma accompanied him, and shut
up her house; what was to be done
with me, engaged much of his thoughts;
at last he determined to place me here,
with this worthy farmer, till his return.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/p048.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p><i>Saving the hen.</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>I must say I have experienced much
kindness, but I never can like any
mortal so well as my dear Augustus;
he will, when he returns, be grown
almost a man, but his kind heart must
ever be the same.</p>

<p class='c006'>I anticipate the greatest pleasure
from introducing my children to him,
and I hope, when he comes, and I
point him out to you, you will all behave
with propriety to him. Yes,
that we will, dear mother, how we long
to see him; but I hope you have not
finished your adventures, exclaimed
Dickey (the little chicken who had
been so angry about his worm) I should
never be tired of hearing you. But I
hope, my child, you have obtained
more than entertainment; do you
still think I should kill the bantum?
Oh no! no, if I never meet with any
greater troubles, I shall be a happy bird
indeed; how trifling it must have
appeared to you.</p>

<p class='c006'>I wish, said the mother, you could
all be advised, to look upon the present
evils as trifling, by considering that
at this present moment, there are thousands
of our species suffering the most
dreadful tortures; it is our duty to
contribute as much as possible to
general happiness, by forbearance and
patience.</p>

<p class='c006'>When I first came to this farm, I
determined to make friends not only
of my own species, but of the ducks,
geese, and pigeons; and I have succeeded,
by small acts of civility; and
I am persuaded, there is not a fowl in
the yard, but would oblige me, if it
could; I shall now take you to the
mother of the bantum, who is a modest
young hen, whom I had once an opportunity
of obliging, and I am sure when
she hears of the improper behaviour of
her son, she will punish him.</p>

<p class='c006'>As the good mother imagined the
young bantum was punished, after
which he made apology to Dickey,
they were afterwards very great friends;
the chickens, by adhering strictly to
their mother's advice, passed through
life with ease and comfort to themselves,
and were respected by all who
knew them.</p>

<p class='c006'>I hope a little history may not be
quite unprofitable to children; who,
by giving way a little to each other's
caprices, will have more happiness
themselves, and be more loved by their
companions.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>PITY.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c005'>In the happy period of the golden age,
when all the celestial inhabitants descended
to the earth, and conversed
familiarly with mortals, amongst the
most cherished of the heavenly powers
were twins, the offspring of Jupiter,
Love and Joy. Wherever they appeared,
the flowers sprung up beneath
their feet, the sun shone with a brighter
radiance, and all nature seemed embellished
by their presence. They were
inseparable companions, and their
growing attachment was favoured by
Jupiter, who had decreed that a lasting
union should be solemnized between
them as soon as they were arrived at
maturer years. But in the mean time
the sons of men deviated from their
native innocence; Vice and Ruin overran
the earth with giant strides; and
Astrea, with her train of celestial visitants
forsook their polluted abodes.
Love alone remained, having been
stolen away by Hope, who was his
nurse, and conveyed by her to the
forests of Arcadia, where he was
brought up among the shepherds. But
Jupiter assigned him a different partner,
and commanded him to espouse
Sorrow, the daughter of Até. He complied
with reluctance; for her features
were harsh and disagreeable, her eyes
sunk, her forehead contracted into perpetual
wrinkles; and her temples
were covered with a wreath of cypress
and wormwood. From this union
sprung a virgin, in whom might be
traced a strong resemblance to both
her parents; but the sullen and unamiable
features of her mother were so
mixed and blended with the sweetness
of her father, that her countenance,
though mournful, was highly pleasing.
The maids and shepherds of the neighbouring
plains gathered round, and
called her Pity. A red-breast was
observed to build in the cabin where
she was born; and while she was yet
an infant, a dove pursued by a hawk
flew into her bosom. This nymph had
a dejected appearance, but so soft and
gentle a mien, that she was beloved to
a degree of enthusiasm. Her voice
was low and plaintive, but inexpressibly
sweet; and she loved to lie for
hours together on the banks of some
wild and melancholy stream, singing
to her lute.--She taught men to weep,
for she took a strange delight in tears;
and often, when the virgins of the
hamlet were assembled at their evening
sports, she would steal in amongst
them, and captivate their hearts by her
tales of charming sadness. She wore
on her head a garland composed of her
father's myrtles, twisted with her mother's
cypress.</p>

<p class='c006'>Pity was commanded by Jupiter to
follow the steps of her mother through
the world, dropping balm into the
wounds she made, and binding up the
hearts she had broken. She goes with
her hair loose, her bosom bare and
throbbing, her garments torn by briars,
and her feet bleeding with the roughness
of the path. The nymph is mortal,
for her mother is so; and when
she has filled her destined course upon
the earth, they shall both expire together,
and Love be again united to
Joy, his immortal and long-betrothed
bride.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>PRINCE ARTHUR AND HUBERT.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c005'>Prince Arthur was nephew to John,
King of England, and had a stronger
title by his birthright to the crown,
than his uncle, being the son of Geoffrey,
John's elder brother. The power
of innocence is strikingly displayed
in the influence it had over the mind
of Hubert, who had devoted himself to
be the guilty instrument of John's injustice
and cruelty, had not the feelings
of humanity and nature wrought
too powerfully to permit him to execute
his wicked design.</p>

    <div>HUBERT AND ATTENDANTS.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'><i>Hubert.</i> Heat me these irons, and
be sure keep within call: when I
stamp with my foot, come in, and bind
the boy that will be with me, fast to
the chair. Take heed, and listen to
my call.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Attendant.</i> I hope you have authority
for what you do.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Hub.</i> Obey my orders, and let me
have none of your scruples; for the
present retire! Young lad, come here,
I have something to say to you.</p>

<div class='c007'>(<i>Prince Arthur comes in.</i></div>

<p class='c006'><i>Arthur.</i> Good morrow, Hubert.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Hub.</i> Good morrow, little prince.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Arth.</i> You look sad, good Hubert.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Hub.</i> To say truth, I am not very
happy.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Arth.</i> Heaven take pity on me! I
think nobody should be sad but I.
Were I but out of prison, and a shepherd's
boy, I could be cheerful all day
long; nay, even here I could be happy,
were I not afraid my uncle intends me
harm. I fear him, and he fears me.
Is it my fault that I was Geoffrey's
son? Oh! that I were but your
son, so you would but love me, Hubert.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Hub.</i> If I listen to his innocent
prattle, I shall awaken that compassion
I have taken so much pains to stifle;
therefore I will lose no time.</p>

<div class='c007'>(<i>Aside.</i></div>

<p class='c006'><i>Arth.</i> Are you ill, Hubert? you
look very pale; if you were ill, I
would attend you night and day,
would watch by you, and show how
much I love you.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Hub.</i> How his words affect me! he
shakes my resolution, but I will be
firm, and smother these womanish
feelings. Arthur, read that paper.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Arth.</i> (<i>Reads</i>). Alas! alas! and
will you burn out both my eyes?</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Hub.</i> I must and will.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Arth.</i> Can you be so cruel? I have
always loved you tenderly, have behaved
to you as if I had been your
son, watched your very looks, obeyed
your orders, attended you when you
were sick, and rejoiced at every symptom
of recovery. Can you have the
heart to put my eyes out? which
never did, nor never shall, frown upon
you.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Hub.</i> I have sworn to do it, and
must not break my oath.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Arth.</i> It is better to break a wicked
promise than to keep it. Had you
a child you fondly loved, think
what you would suffer to have him
treated thus? My innocence should
plead for me. I could not have believed
that Hubert had been so hard-hearted.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Hub.</i> Come in (<i>Stamps, the attendants
come in with cords, irons, &amp;c.</i>),
do as I bid you.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Arth.</i> Oh! save me, Hubert, save
me. The fierce looks of these bloody
men terrify me to death.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Hub.</i> Give me the irons, I say, and
bind him here.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Arth.</i> Alas! you need not be so
rough, there is no occasion to bind me.
I will be as gentle as a lamb, if you will
but send these men away. I will not
stir nor make a noise, whatever pain
you put me to.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Hub.</i> Withdraw, and leave me alone
with him.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Atten.</i> I am glad to be rid of such a
business.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Arth.</i> Alas! then I have driven
away my friend, let him come back,
that he may plead for me.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Hub.</i> Come, boy, prepare yourself.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Arth.</i> Will nothing avail me?</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Hub.</i> Nothing; prepare.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Arth.</i> Oh! Hubert, that a gnat
would fly in your eye, that you might
feel the pain so small a thing would
cause; perhaps that might move your
sympathy, and lead you to consider
what I must suffer.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Hub.</i> How ill you keep your promise,
be silent.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Arth.</i> Forgive me, Hubert, if I try
to move you; you once were tender
and compassionate, and you will be
happier from yielding to these gentle
dispositions, than from all the
wealth and honours my uncle can bestow.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Hub.</i> Well, your innocence has
unnerved my firmest resolution. I am
subdued, and will not touch your eyes
for all the treasures of your uncle's
crown. Yet have I sworn, and fully
purposed to have performed----.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Arth.</i> O, now you look like Hubert!
Before you were disguised.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Hub.</i> Hush, be quiet; I must conceal
you from your uncle's vengeance
till I have an opportunity of escaping
with you to a foreign country, where
we shall be secure from his resentment.
For your sake I resign all my hopes of
preferment, and incur the danger of my
life, should I be taken whilst in your
uncle's territories; but, poverty with
innocence, is infinitely preferable to a
crown with a guilty conscience. Fear
nothing, but retire; not India's wealth
should bribe me to injure you.</p>

    <div>THE DRUNKARD.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Philip the Good, duke of Burgundy,
taking a walk one evening at Bruges,
found in the public square a man laying
on the ground, where he was
soundly asleep. He had him taken up,
and carried to his palace, where, after
they had stripped him of his rags, and
put on him a fine shirt, and a nightcap,
placed him in one of the prince's
beds. This drunkard was much surprized,
when he awoke, to find himself
in a beautiful alcove, surrounded by
officers more richly dressed the one
than the other. They asked him, what
suit his highness wished to put on that
day? This demand completed his confusion;
but after a thousand positive
assurances he gave them, that he was
but a poor cobbler, and not at all a
prince, he resolved quietly to bear all
the honours they loaded him with,--suffered
them to dress him, appeared
in public,--heard mass in the Ducal
chapel, and kissed the mass-book,--in
a word, they made him perform all
the usual ceremonies: he went to a
sumptuous table, then to cards, to the
walk, and other entertainments. After
supper they gave him a ball. The
good man having never found himself
at a like feast, took freely the wine
they offered to him, and so abundantly
that he got brave and drunk. It was
then the catastrophe of the comedy
was brought about. Whilst he was
sleeping himself sober, the duke had
him clothed again with his rags, and
carried back to the place from whence
he had been taken at first. After
having passed there all night in a sound
sleep, he awoke, and went home to relate
to his wife, as a dream of his,
what in effect had really happened to
him.</p>

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project

terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
